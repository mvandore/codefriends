#If statements notes
-npm = node package manager, you need to know which package you want to install 
-prompt-sync = library that allows code to prompt a response (get user input); this is good if you want to make code dependent on user input (e.g.,quizzes, etc)
-in order to use a library

-npm init = init = initialize, not sure what npm is, that allows you to initialize npm, you want to do this inside the directory where you want to initialize npm
-npm install PACKAGE (a package.json file will be created)
-cat package.json (not sure what this does)
-FILENAME.js will allow you to write a javascript script
-to run a javascript script: node ./FILE.js

-syntax:
- if(CONDITION){
    CONSEQUENCE
} ...I think this was also in your homework notes
-console.log(`TEXT ${} TEXT`) for string interpolation, that you way you can stick the value of a variable in that statement
