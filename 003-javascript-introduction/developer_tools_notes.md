Java = a programming language
Javascript = a *different* programming language that can be used inside of the web browser; you can use the interpreter to interact with the web browser. Considered an interpreted language, different that compiled language that doesn't need to be interpreted. Python and Ruby are also considered interpreted languages
Javascript interpreters -> under Developer Tools in Chrome, the other you can access via command line, called "node" (just type node in the command line in hyper)

Topics covered:
-data types
-math operators: +, <, etc, Math.pow - raising first number to power of second (e.g., Math.paw(2,3) = 2*2*2 = 8)
-boolean operators: && to check if multiple conditions are true, === (triple equal sign is asking "is this equal?"), || (or), ! (not)
-creating variables: let, e.g., let state = 'RI', command: let VAR = 
    variable declaration: let VAR, that's a way to create a variable without assigning anything to it, you can only declare a VAR one time in your code
    variable assignment/definition: = DEFINITION
    declaring a constant variable: const creates a constant variable that you can't change
-change strings to numbers: parseInt(VAR)
-string interpolation -- you can only do this with the backtick ` (to the left of the 1 on your keyboard), this allows you to add a variable so that when the string prints, it prints with the relevant value in place the variable
-to quit node interpreter: .exit or ctrl + C

Resources for JavaScript
Mozilla Developer Network (MDN), developer.mozilla.org, there's a lot of documentation about JavaScript commands

To write a JavaScript script, you make a .js script in the command line
