3 things I learned in class:
1. How to make a new directory: mk dir
2. How to navigate between directories: cd
3. How to open Visual Studio Code: code

Other notes from homework:
chom +x "scriptname" to change permission
touch creates a new file, code opens file in text editor
rm -r removes a directory that's not empty
grep allows you to filter through your command history
